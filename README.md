# AI filmmaking camera control with Seedance 2.5 and three.js: the pill pipeline

**Direct the camera of an AI film made with Seedance 2.5, with a 3D camera you wrote in code.** 137 filmmaking camera moves: dolly, crane, orbit, whip pan, FPV, one-takes, action and famous shots. The move, speed, framing and cuts come from your code, not from the model's guess. The model still makes the people and the place.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/hero-three-stages.gif" alt="A grey 3D scene, the same scene with people as striped pills, and what the video model made from it" width="100%"></p>

The trick is one sentence: **a reference video carries two things, where the camera goes and how the bodies move, and the model copies both. So give it a camera to follow and nobody to copy.** Every person and product in the 3D clip is a striped pill. The pill gives the model the place, the size, the facing and the timing, and has no body to copy. The prompt says what everything really is.

**Run it on Tein:** Seedance 2.5 is generated through [Tein](https://tein.ai). [Sign up at tein.ai](https://tein.ai), create an API key, and use the Tein MCP or API (setup in [docs/tein-endpoint.md](docs/tein-endpoint.md), the full reference in [docs/tein/](docs/tein/)). This repo never stores a key.

This repo is the whole pipeline: the three.js engine, **137 templates** with their code, pill clips, prompts and Seedance results, the 24 places, what we learned, and the Tein setup for generating the videos.

**Words used here.**

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Pill | A striped capsule or pin, as tall as the person it stands for. It replaces a person in the 3D clip. It has no limbs. |
| Pill clip | The grey 3D clip you render: set, pills and the camera move. This is the reference video. |
| Template | One camera move or shot as a small code file, with its pill clip, prompts and results. |
| Draft | A 480p preview made with `draft: true`. It costs less, and can be finalized later. |
| Sketch route | Sending a contact sheet of drawn frames instead of the video. |

Tein (tein.ai) hosts Seedance 2.5 and runs the gallery this repo grew from. You need your own Tein account and key; this repo never stores one. Made by Sirio Berati, TEIN AI.

## How it works

| 1. Build the move in code | 2. People become pills | 3. The model makes the shot |
|---|---|---|
| A grey 3D set and a camera path, written in three.js (no Blender). One small file per template. | Each person is a striped pill, as tall as they are, with a white dot where their eyes face. No body to copy. | The pill clip goes to the model with your photo and a prompt. It returns the real shot, keeping the same camera move. |

## The same move, six inputs

One move (an orbit round a walking man) sent six ways. The pill is the one that keeps the camera exact and the people natural.

| What we sent | What the model made |
|---|---|
| <img src="docs/assets/looks-CAM06-Orbit-inputs.gif" width="100%"> | <img src="docs/assets/looks-CAM06-Orbit-outputs.gif" width="100%"> |

Why each one was kept or dropped: [docs/variants.md](docs/variants.md) and [docs/failure-ladder.md](docs/failure-ladder.md).

## Two routes: the video, and the sketch

The pill **video** is the exact route: every cut lands on the frame. The **sketch** route draws the same scene as a contact sheet of frames: cheaper and more natural, but a sheet has no clock, so cuts drift by about half a second.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/routes-CAM06-Orbit.gif" alt="The pill clip, what it made, and what the sketch sheet made" width="60%"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="templates/CAM06-Orbit/sketch-sheet.jpg" alt="The contact sheet that was sent" width="60%"><br><sub>The contact sheet that was sent for the sketch route.</sub></p>

The numbers, and when to use which: [docs/why/why-video-first-sheet-second.md](docs/why/why-video-first-sheet-second.md).

## Try it in ten minutes

You need Node 22.12 or newer, ffmpeg, and network access once (Remotion downloads a headless Chrome on the first render). The first install and render take a few minutes.

```bash
cd engine/cinematic && npm install
tools/render-pill.sh CAM06-Orbit        # a 7 s, 24 fps, 21:9 pill clip, written to .work/out/pill/
```

The `pill.mp4` files in this repo are smaller gallery copies (mostly 960 wide); the render script above makes the full 1280x534 clip, and `sent.json` records the size that was sent.

Open `templates/CAM06-Orbit/`: `template.ts` is the shot as code, `prompts/` holds the prompts (`sent.json` says which are the text that was sent and which are recovered or rebuilt copies), and `sent.json` holds the references in order and the settings. Send it as a draft through Tein's Seedance 2.5 (see [docs/tein-endpoint.md](docs/tein-endpoint.md)): the pill clip is `reference_video`, your photo is `reference_image`. Judge the draft against the pill clip before you finalize anything.

**Build your own template** in about 12 lines: [docs/build-your-own-template.md](docs/build-your-own-template.md).

## Use it with Tein's MCP or API

Generating a video goes through Tein's Seedance 2.5, either as the Tein MCP or as the API. Both need a Tein key from tein.ai; this repo never stores one. The setup is in [docs/tein-endpoint.md](docs/tein-endpoint.md): getting a key, the two MCP servers, the request for a template, drafts and finalizing, limits and costs. A separate helper project (an MCP and a skill that guide a beginner through all of this) is not part of this repo.

## What is in the repo

| Folder | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `engine/cinematic/` | The renderer: three.js inside Remotion, the stand-ins, the rigs, the checks. The CC0 rig is in `public/kit/`. |
| `templates/<ID>/` | One folder per template: `template.ts`, `pill.mp4`, `preview.gif`, `prompts/`, `sent.json`, `README.md`, `reproduce.md`, and the sketch sheet where that route was used. 75 pill clips use the single capsule and 62 the pin (a head on a slim body); each README says which. |
| `docs/` | The method, the why pages, every rule, the failures and fixes, the prompt anatomy, the Seedance and Tein notes, costs, QA. Start with [docs/idea.md](docs/idea.md). |
| `tools/seedance/` | The sketch-sheet maker, the prompt builders and gates, and the video checks (camera, cuts, framing, speech, mouth). |
| `answers/` | 137 questions about the method, each answered with its evidence and a status; 4 are marked UNPROVEN. |
| `environments/` | The 24 place references and their moods. |
| `skills/cinematic-previs/` | The skill behind the engine's checks: the camera and cut rulebook and the stills-first QA loop. |
| `gallery/` | The one-page gallery: open `gallery/index.html`, nothing to install. |

Large result videos are release downloads, not files in git: download `camera-control-results.zip` from the [v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/sirioberati/ai-filmmaking-camera-control-seedance-2-5/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and unzip it at the repo root to get `release-media/`. The whole clone is about 440 MB. What does not work yet, and what was never tested: [docs/known-limits.md](docs/known-limits.md).

## Things that matter most

- Name every stand-in in the prompt and say no pill ever appears in the result.
- Rebuild the set in words. Without it the model copies the grey cones, boxes and spheres.
- Move the camera in every clip you send, and hold every shot and every camera effect for 2 seconds or more. The locked-off templates (CAM01, CAM26, CAM29, CAM30, CAM46, FAM03, the ANG family) are kept as camera studies, not as templates to send. A few older templates have shots under 2 s; they were built before the rule.
- A conversation needs exact spoken lines in their own block near the top of the prompt.
- Never finalize a draft until the draft is right.
