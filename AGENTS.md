# AGENTS.md: AI filmmaking camera control with Seedance 2.5 and three.js

For AI agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor, others). Read this first.

## What this repo is
A way to control the camera of a Seedance 2.5 video. You write the camera move in three.js, render a grey "pill clip" (people are striped pills), and send that clip to Seedance 2.5 as the reference video with a face photo and a prompt. The model copies the camera and invents the people and the place. 137 ready templates, each with code, clip, prompts and results.

## В этом форке: Seedance через наш BytePlus, не Tein
Видео шлём через `tools/byteplus/send.mjs` (обёртка над скиллом `seedance`, ключ `ARK_API_KEY` из `~/.config/genproducer/.env`). Tein не используем. Инструкция: `tools/byteplus/README.md`. По умолчанию скрипт делает dry-run; `--go` – платная отправка, только после явного «да» на конкретный запрос.

## Generate through Tein (upstream, not used here)
Videos are generated with Seedance 2.5 on Tein (tein.ai), by the Tein MCP or the Tein API. This needs the person's own Tein key (`TEIN_API_KEY`). They sign up at https://tein.ai and create the key there. Never ask for the key in chat, never write it to a file, never commit it. Setup and the full reference: `docs/tein-endpoint.md` and `docs/tein/` (`api-reference.md`, `mcp-setup.md`, `limits.md`, `billing.md`).

## Rules for agents
1. Never send a request to a video service, and never spend credits, without the person's explicit yes for that exact request. Show the request and the price first.
2. Start with a 480p draft (`draft: true`), check it against the pill clip, and finalize only when it is right.
3. Move the camera in every clip you send. Hold every shot 2 seconds or more.
4. The stand-in is a striped pill with no limbs. Name every stand-in in the prompt and say no pill appears in the result. Rebuild the set in words.
5. Prompts under `templates/<ID>/prompts/` are examples, and `sent.json` says whether each was the text sent, a recovered copy or a rebuilt one. Rebuild before reuse.
